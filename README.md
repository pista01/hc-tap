# Bigtreetech Hermit Crab CAN (V1/V2) Voron TAP

I've been running this version of TAP with the HC V1 CAN for a few months now. Recently upgraded to the V2 HC CAN.  

All the parts are the same between the versions except the Carraige Frame.  Those are clearly marked.


Note: As was required in V1, this TAP used an mgn12 carriage for the verticle.  Looks like this HC might support mgn9.  Maybe a future option.

F360 file is included, so hack away.
